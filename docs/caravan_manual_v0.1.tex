\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The CARAVAN platform has been designed to provide decision makers and civil
protection authorities with a tool that allows a prompt estimation of the impact
of an earthquake. The platform can be used to understand the extent and the
amount of loss related to the occurrence of a damaging event, in a simple and
intuitive way. 

The input scenario can be either specified manually using the left-side tab (see
section \ref{sec:web gui/ev param}), or can be selected from a list of events
provided by external services (see section \ref{sec:web gui/ev sources}). The
scenario parameters can be anyway modified, before the computation of related
ground-motion and loss estimates. For most of the parameters, a related
uncertainty can be specified. This uncertainty will be consequently propagated
in the internal computation, and accounted for in the resulting estimates.
\\
\\
\textbf{NOTE}: The CARAVAN platform is still in development and testing. As
such, some of the described functionalities can be incomplete or can provide
unexpected results. In order to provide us with suggestions and comments, and a
prompt feedback on bugs and missing features, write an email to
\emph{pittore@gfz-potsdam.de}.

\subsection{Structure of the application}
\label{sec:intro/structure}
The caravan platform is composed by a three-layered structure, shown in
fig.~\ref{fig:struct}. The back-end relational database is hosting all necessary
models for both ground-motion computation and loss estimation. The
\textbf{database} is based on the well known PostgreSQL/postGIS open-source
solution, and its extended geographical support allows for a sophisticated
management of spatial information. 
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{struct_01}
	\captionof{figure}{Sketch of CARAVAN platform´s structure.
\label{fig:struct} }
	
\end{center}
In particular, the database hosts the exposure/vulnerability model of the
Country, which is defined over a specific 2-dimensional tessellation of the
geographical area.

\textbf{Note}: we define a \emph{tessellation} as a spatial subdivision of a planar surface into a set of neighbouring
polygons (referred to as geocells) of different shapes and area. 

An example of
such tessellation is shown in fig.~\ref{fig:tess1}. The tessellation provides
the basic spatial support of the computation, since every geocell contains all
necessary data to carry out the different computation stages. The area of the
geocells is inversely proportional to the estimated number of people living
within. Therefore, in densely inhabited areas, a spatially denser dataset is
used, and thus a higher spatial resolution of the resulting estimates. 
%More details can be found in section \ref{sec:data model}.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tess_exposure1}
	\captionof{figure}{Example of the multi-resolution tessellation used to
describe the exposure-vulnerability model. The single geocells are color-mapped
according to their density of inhabitants.\label{fig:tess1} }
\end{center}

The \textbf{processing modules} are carrying out the necessary
computations. In particular, the ground-motion computation module estimates the
probabilistic distribution of ground motion, while the loss computation module
estimates the expected impact in terms of the probabilistic distribution of
fatalities. Both computation are carried out for each geocell of the
tessellation, independently and in parallel. More information is provided in
section \ref{sec:impact comp}. 

The last stage of the CARAVAN platform is the visualization and dissemination
interface. This component provides the user with a simple set of components for
the selection and modification of scenario event parameters and processing
properties. Moreover, an interactive slippy map allows the users to browse the
processed data. The elements of the interface are described in more detail in
section \ref{sec:web gui}.

\newpage
\section{The CARAVAN Web interface}
\label{sec:web gui}

The CARAVAN main web interface is displayed in fig. \ref{fig:web gui}. The interface is composed by an interactive map (see section \ref{sec:web
gui/map}), and a navigation bar hosting both the \emph{event description} and the
\emph{process settings} (see respectively \ref{sec:web gui/ev param} and
\ref{sec:web gui/proc param})). A single \emph{run button} is triggering the
computation.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{caravan_web_gui1}
	\captionof{figure}{CARAVAN Web graphical User Interface
(GUI).\label{fig:web gui} }
\end{center}

The left side bar of the CARAVAN web interface contains the basic functional
buttons and both the event scenario and the model parameters (described in the
next sections).
The basic functional buttons, shown in fig.~\ref{fig:gui ev pars} (left), allow
the users to activate some of the interface functions. In particular:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[h)]{\textbf{Multilingual support}. Changes the interface language.
Currently available languages are: english, german, russian and chinese. More
languages can be added at a later stage.}
	\item[m)]{\textbf{Tooltips}. When the tooltips are enabled, by clicking
on the left-side text of one of the event parameters a pop-up short help will be
displayed.}
	\item[p)]{\textbf{GEOFON link}. Opens the GEOFON event import module.
This module, if enabled, continuously download from the GEOFON network all
events occurred in the selected Country within a specific magnitude range
(currently events with magnitude $>$ 5). \textbf{NOTE: experimental feature}.}
	\item[n)]{\textbf{FDSN event query}. Opens the FDSN event import
module. See section \ref{sec:web gui/ev sources}.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Event description}
\label{sec:web gui/ev param}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[trim=0mm 20mm 0mm 0mm,clip,
width=\textwidth]{gui_ev_params_comment}
	\captionof{figure}{Event description.\label{fig:gui ev pars} }
\end{center}

The event description (right side, in fig.~\ref{fig:gui ev pars})allows the user to
define the basic properties of the desired/selected event:  

\begin{itemize}
	\item[a)]{\textbf{Event location}. Longitude and latitude, in decimal
degrees, of the event. By typing a sequence of two numbers (separated by either
spaces, a comma or a semicolon), the coordinate will be considered as following
a normal (gaussian) distribution, where the first number is the mean, and the
second the standard deviation. \\ For instance: \fbox{74.0 0.1} means
that the longitude of the event´s epicentre is defined by a gaussian
distribution with mean $\mu=74.0$ degrees and standard deviation $\sigma=0.1$
degrees. In other terms, considering that 95.5\% of values of a normal distribution lie within a confidence interval 
of $\mu \pm 2\sigma$, the longitude of the event will be, with a probability of 95.5\%, in the range $(73.8,74.2)$.}
	\item[b)]{\textbf{Focal depth}. Indicates the depth of the earthquake´s
hypocenter, in km. When two values are provided, they will be interpreted as the
interval of a uniform distribution. For instance: \fbox{10 20} means that
the hypocentral depth of the event can be comprised anywhere between 10 and 20
km.}
	\item[c)]{\textbf{Event magnitude}. Moment magnitude ($M_w$) of the
event. The magnitude measures the size of the event in terms of the energy
released, and is based on the seismic moment of the earthquake. When two values
are provided, they will be interpreted as the interval of a uniform distribution
(see above).}
	\item[d)]{\textbf{Type of rupture}. Specifies whether the seismic source
has to be considered a point, or an extended source. In the latter case, three
more parameters have to be provided:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[e)]{\textbf{Style of faulting}. A fault is a planar fracture
or discontinuity in a volume of rock, along which there has been significant
displacement as a result of rock mass movement. Large faults within the Earth's
crust result from the action of plate tectonic forces, with the largest forming
the boundaries between the plates, such as subduction zones or transform faults.
Energy release associated with rapid movement on active faults is the cause of
most earthquakes. 
A fault plane is the plane that represents the fracture surface of a fault. A
fault trace or fault line is the intersection of a fault plane with the ground
surface. A fault trace is also the line commonly plotted on geologic maps to
represent a fault. The two sides of a non-vertical fault are known as the
hanging wall and footwall. By definition, the hanging wall occurs above the
fault plane and the footwall occurs below the fault.

Based on the direction of slip (the mechanism of rupturing), the faults ruptures
are usually assigned with different categories (see fig.~\ref{fig:style of
faulting}), which have to be taken into account in order to estimate the
resulting ground motion. The possible options are:
			\begin{center}
			
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{style_of_faulting}
				\captionof{figure}{Different faulting
styles (image courtesy of SMS-Tsunami-Warning.com).\label{fig:style of faulting} }
			\end{center}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{\emph{Normal}. The block above the fault moves
down relative to the block below the fault. This fault motion is caused by
tensional forces and results in extension.}
			\item{\emph{Reverse}. In a reverse fault, the block
above the fault moves up relative to the block below the fault. This fault
motion is caused by compressional forces and results in shortening. A reverse
fault is called a thrust fault if the dip of the fault plane is small.}
			\item{\emph{Strike-slip}. In a strike-slip fault, the
movement of blocks along a fault is horizontal. If the block on the far side of
the fault moves to the left, as shown in this animation, the fault is called
left-lateral. If the block on the far side moves to the right, the fault is
called right-lateral. The fault motion of a strike-slip fault is caused by
shearing forces.}
			\item{\emph{Unknown}. Select this option if the style of
the fault is not known.}
		\end{itemize}}
		\item[f)]{\textbf{Fault strike}. The strike is an angle used to
specify the orientation of the fault and measured clockwise from north. For
example, a strike of 0° or 180° indicates a fault that is oriented in a
north-south direction, 90° or 270° indicates east-west oriented structure. To
remove the ambiguity, we always specify the strike such that when you "look" in
the strike direction, the fault dips to you right. 
			\begin{center}
			
\includegraphics[trim=0mm 90mm 70mm 0mm, width=\textwidth]{strike_dip}
				\captionof{figure}{Geometry of
Strike (left side) and Dip (right side) of a normal or reverse fault (image courtesy of PennState College of Earth and Mineral Science).\label{fig:strike def} }
			\end{center}}
		\item[g)]{\textbf{Fault dip}. Indicates the orientation the
fault is taking from vertical to horizontal. Dip is the angle that describes the
steepness of the fault surface. This angle is measured from Earth's surface, or
a plane parallel to Earth's surface. The dip of a horizontal fault is 0
degrees, and the dip of a vertical fault is 90 degrees. When two values are
provided, they will be interpreted as the interval of a uniform distribution
(see above).}
	\end{itemize}}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Process settings}
\label{sec:web gui/proc param}
This section of the CARAVAN interface contains several parameters which are
currently used in the testing phase. A brief description of the parameters is
provided in the following.
\\ \\
\fbox{\textbf{NOTE}: some of these parameters are experimental, therefore we
suggest not to change them!}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[trim=0mm 40mm 60mm 0mm,clip,
width=\textwidth]{gui_model_params_comment}
	\captionof{figure}{Model parameters.\label{fig:gui proc pars} }
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[a)]{\textbf{Intensity Prediction Equation (IPE)}. Specific IPE to
be used in the ground motion simulation. More details can be found in
section~\ref{sec:impact comp/ground motion}.}
	\item[b)]{\textbf{Target Area}. Selection of the geocells involved in
the computation can be done based on the minimal expected intensity (e. g. only
the cells which will experience an intensity I $\ge I_{ref}=5$ will be
selected), or just the area in view can be selected for the processing.}
	\item[c)]{\textbf{No-loss binary flag}. If the flag is checked, no loss
computation will be carried out, only ground motion.}
	\item[d)]{\textbf{Distribution size (EXPERIMENTAL)}.In order to propagate uncertainties in the computation, a Monte Carlo sampling approach is followed. Each variable is thus defined by a probability distribution, instead of a single scalar value. This parameter defines the size of the empirical distribution used to carry out the sampling (suggested
values: between 40 and 1000).}
	\item[e)]{\textbf{Active tessellation (EXPERIMENTAL)}. Different tessellations can be implemented, and are stored in the CARAVAN database. This parameter specifies the specific database identifier (ID) of the
tessellation to be used for the computation.}
	\item[f)]{\textbf{Reference intensity}. Minimal intensity (in EMS98 /
MSK64) to be reached or exceeded in a geocell for the cell to be selected for
computation. The higher is this intensity, the less geocells will be used for
the computation, and the smaller will be the area involved in the overall
estimation.}
	\item[g)]{\textbf{Intensity sample distance (EXPERIMENTAL)}. Minimal
distance in km between consecutive samples. This parameter is used to compute
the spatial extent of the area to be involved in the computation.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{FDSN event sources}
\label{sec:web gui/ev sources}

The user of the CARAVAN platform can either create an event scenario manually by
specifying all the parameters needed, or an already existing
event can be downloaded and selected from an external source. 
Currently, three sources are available, which allow for querying and downloading
the events contained in their database systems according to the FDSN standard
format provided by the International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks
(see \url{https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/}). Currently the following sources
have been implemented:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{EMSC}. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre was
founded in 1975, following a recommendation from the European Seismological
Commission (ESC). The ESC is a regional commission of the International
Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI), itself a
specialized association of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics
(IUGG).}
	\item{\textbf{IRIS}. Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology.
IRIS is a consortium of over 120 US universities dedicated to the operation of
science facilities for the acquisition, management, and distribution of
seismological data. IRIS provides management of, and access to, observed and
derived data for the global earth science community.}
	\item{\textbf{INGV}. the Italian \emph{Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e
Vulcanologia} provides access and retrieval of the earthquake information
contained in the INGV archives.}
\end{itemize}
More sources will be added in the future platform releases. 
 
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gui_fdsn}
	\captionof{figure}{Model parameters.\label{fig:gui fdsn} }
\end{center}

In order to load a scenario event from a FDSN service, the user has to click on
the button (see item \emph{n)} in fig.~\ref{fig:gui ev pars} left). A new pop-up
window will be displayed (see fig.~\ref{fig:gui fdsn}). On the left, the query
parameters allow to specify the main properties of the desired event. In
particular it is possible to filter the events based on their geographical
coordinates (the query is currently initialized with the boundary of Kyrgyztan),
on their magnitude, focal depth or occurrence date. By clicking on the button
\emph{Query events} the query is sent and the answer from the remote server is
parsed and displayed as a table. If the received data include uncertainty
estimates on some of the parameters, these are displayed as well.
By clicking on the headers of the different table columns, it is possible to
sort the list accordingly (e. g. based on the magnitude). 
Eventually the user can select a specific event by clicking on it, and load it
into the event description by clikcing on the button \emph{Choose selected}. 
Once the event has been loaded in the event description, all parameters can be
further modified before starting over the processsing phases. For instance the
user can decide to change some of the values, or to manually add uncertainties
to the parameters in order to account for lack of information in the
characterization of the scenario.


\subsection{Interactive map}
\label{sec:web gui/map}

The interactive map provides the main interface with the CARAVAN users. The map
features a tiled background, shown in fig.~\ref{fig:map1}, which provides the
basic information layer. This background is currently queried from the global,
opensource OpenStreetMap (OSM, see \url{http://www.osm.org}) initiative.
OpenStreetMap is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain
data about geographical features, settlements, roads, buildings, and much more
at a global scale, although with different levels of completeness and quality.
In Kyrgyzstan, the spatial coverage and thematic detail of OSM map is
remarkable, and can be efficiently used as a background providing a basic
geographical framework for the localization of the scenario events. Moreover, in
Central Asia most of the labels of settlements and topographical features are
provided natively in Russian language.
\\
On top of the tiled map, a vector layer is superimposed when the results from
the processing stages are available. This vector layer is composed by a set of
geometric primitives in form of polygons, each with a set of attributes. The
polygons represent the geocells of the tessellation which have been selected for
processing (see section \ref{sec:web gui/proc param} and \ref{sec:impact
comp}). 
The set of attributes, as well as the color of the geocells depends on the
specific layer which is visualized.   

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{map1}
	\captionof{figure}{Interactive map. A graphic symbol denotes the
location of the event´s epicentre.\label{fig:map1} }
\end{center}

When visualizing the resulting spatial distribution of ground motion, the
geocells´ attribute used for visualization is the mean value of macroseismic
intensity. By hovering the mouse over the geocells, the related probability
distribution over the different discrete values of intensity is shown in a
separate, overlaying window. The figure \ref{fig:map2} shows an example of
the resulting distribution. As it is possible to note, in the selected geocell (the
one the mouse is currently over) the most likely intensity to be experienced is
7 (we consider EMS-98 and MSK64 scales as effectively equivalent). Nevertheless,
there is a significant likelihood (40\%) that an intensity 8 will be
experienced. This distribution encodes the resulting uncertainty over the event
parameters which is propagated throughout the process, as described in section
\ref{sec:impact comp/ground motion}.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{map2}
	\captionof{figure}{Interactive map of ground motion. By hovering the
mouse on the geocells involved in the computation, the probability distribution
over the discrete intensity values (in EMS98 / MSK-64) is shown.
\label{fig:map2} }
\end{center}

In a similar manner, the user can switch from the visualization of ground motion
to the visualization of loss. In this case the vector layer superimposed to the
background tiles will always be composed by the same geocells, but attributes
related to loss estimation will be visualized instead. 
In figure \ref{fig:map3} an example related to the ground motion distribution
shown in fig.~\ref{fig:map2} is provided. The color of the geocells is now
proportional to the mean of expected fatalities, and a correponding probability
distribution is provided. In the selected cell the expected value of fatalities
is 16.3, with a corresponding higher probability of it lying in the 10-20
interval, but still with a significant probability (almost 20\%) of a number of
fatalities comprised between 20 and 50. Looking at this distribution we can
conclude that, given the available information, we can expect with almost 90\%
probability a number of fatalities between 10 and 50.
The colormap used, also depicted in the legend shown in the upper-right corner
of the map, provides an immediate panorama of where the loss are expected, and
as it is possible to note by comparing the figures \ref{fig:map2} and
\ref{fig:map3}, not always the locations with higher expected ground motion are
also the ones where highest loss toll is estimated.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{map3}
	\captionof{figure}{Interactive map of loss. By hovering the mouse on the
geocells involved in the computation, the probability distribution over the
expected number of fatalities is shown. \label{fig:map3} }
\end{center}

\newpage
\section{Scenario Impact computation}
\label{sec:impact comp}

Following the selection of a suitable event scenario in terms of earthquake
location, magnitude, hypocentral depth and faulting style, the CARAVAN platform
can start carrying out the necessary processing. The processing stages can be
split in the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{The active area, used to select the geocells involved in the
computation, is estimated.
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{active_area}
	\captionof{figure}{Geocells included in the estimated active area. Also
shown are the corresponding mean intensity value for each cell.\label{fig:active
area} }
\end{center}}
	\item{The geocells are queried from the database within the computed
area.}
	\item{For each geocell, a separate process is spawned and added to a
multiprocess pool.}
	\item{Computation of ground and loss distribution is carried out
independently and in parallel for each geocell. Every single process in the pool
is accessing the database for querying the necessary data and writing back the
resulting estimates. A set of real-time messages are output in the console (see
figure~\ref{fig:loss proc log}) in the left navigation bar. The log messages
include the details of the scenario event used for the simulation, the extent of
the active area based on the event´s properties and the chosen $I_{ref}$, the
number of active geocells, the elapsed time and the 5-95\% percentiles of the
resulting disrtribution of loss across the active geocells. In case of warnings
or errors during the processing, a suitable message is displayed as well in the
console.}
	\item{When all processes complete their task, the platform is
visualizing the resulting distribution according to the layer chosen by the
user.}
\end{enumerate} 

In the following sections, further details on the specific processing stages
related to ground motion and loss estimation are provided.


\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=4cm]{proc_log}
	\captionof{figure}{. \label{fig:loss proc log} }
\end{center}

\subsection{Ground motion}
\label{sec:impact comp/ground motion}

Each geocell first computes the distribution of ground motion which is expected
for the spatial location corresponding to the mass centre of the cell itself
(called \emph{target}).
The computation depends on the event parameters and the user´s choice of the
Ground Motion Intensity Prediction Equation (IPE) as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:ground motion unc prop2}.
In case uncertainty has been specified for some or all of the event parameters,
a corresponding distribution is generated and then propagated through the
computation following a Monte Carlo approach based on the latin-hypercube
sampling methodology. 

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[trim=0mm 30mm 0mm 0mm,clip,
width=\textwidth]{ground_motion_unc_prop2}
	\captionof{figure}{. \label{fig:ground motion unc prop2} }
\end{center}

In figure~\ref{fig:ground motion unc prop1}, upper part, the distributions
encoding the uncertainty on the location, magnitude and depth of the scenario
event are shown. These distribution are propagated using a specific IPE
(actually implemented are either global one proposed by
\cite{allen_intensity_2012} or the one proposed by \cite{bindi_intensity_2011}
foe Central Asia) leading to the resulting probability distribution for the
expected macroseismic intensity in the two spatial locations (targets) which
represent the baricentres of two geocells (see~\ref{fig:ground motion unc
prop1}, lower part).


\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ground_motion_unc_prop1}
	\captionof{figure}{Association between source model, IPE and event
parameters.\label{fig:ground motion unc prop1} }
\end{center}

\subsection{Loss estimation}
\label{sec:impact comp/loss}

The probabilistic distribution of ground motion estimated for each geocell is
used then as input for the loss estimation procedure. The exposure and
vulnerability model, which is also included in the CARAVAN database and
disaggregated at geocell level, is employed to estimate the expected number of
collapsed building for each of the considered building types. The exposure and
vulnerability model for Kyrgyzstan for instance has been developed within
several international projects. The building typologies are described in
\cite{wieland_towards_2015} and \cite{wieland_multiscale_2015}, and the model
has been developed following the approach described in
\cite{pittore_toward_2013}.
The vulnerability model is based on the methodology developed by
\cite{giovinazzi_method_2002}, which proposes a more sophisticated version of
the EMS-98 formulation aimed at vulnerability and risk assessment.
The Mean Damage Grade (MDG) $\mu_d$ of a building structure subject to a ground
motion equivalent to macroseismic intensity $I$, in the proposed approach, is
modelled as:

\begin{equation}
\mu_d=2.5\left(1+tanh(\frac{I+6.5 V-13.1}{2.3})\right)
\end{equation}

where $V$ is the vulnerability index associated to the building (or to its
category). If we consider also the related uncertainties, the vulnerability
index and the intensity are both described by distributions, as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:vuln distrib 1}. 

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[trim=0mm 30mm 0mm 0mm,clip,
width=\textwidth]{vuln_distrib_01}
	\captionof{figure}{Resulting distribution of Mean Damage Grade,
including the uncertainty in ground motion and vulnerability. In the upper right
corner, the distribution of the vulnerability index related to two hypotethical
structures with EMS98 vulnerability A and B is shown. The lower part shows the resulting
distribution of MDR related to the two target locations A and B shown in the
upper left inset, resulting from the propagation of the different uncertainties.
\label{fig:vuln distrib 1} }
\end{center}

For each building typology, the number of collapsed or heavily damaged
buildings, respectively corresponding to damage states 5 and 4 on the EMS98
scale, is used to estimate the expected distribution of fatalities, following
the approach proposed by Coburn and Spence in 2002
(\cite{coburn_earthquake_2002}), as shown in figure~\ref{fig:loss formula}.   

\begin{center}

ground motion.\label{fig:loss formula} }
