	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This work provides an insight into the development of the first harmonized exposure model for Central Asia. The model was derived in the frame of the Earthquake Model Central Asia ({EMCA}) project, which is the regional initiative for Central Asia to the Global Earthquake Model ({GEM}). The {EMCA} exposure model combines commonly used data sources and acquisition techniques (e.g., rapid visual screening) with novel rapid assessment approaches (e.g., satellite remote sensing and omnidirectional imaging) in the framework of an integrated sampling scheme and stores the data in a multi-resolution spatio-temporal database. The exposure model implements a newly developed building typology, harmonized for the five Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) and follows the international building taxonomy of the {GEM}. Emphasis is given to the multi-scale nature and the temporal dynamics of exposure data. Results from a selected urban area are provided to illustrate the current state of the continuously updated exposure model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
